### install

cd into strider deployment and run `npm install strider-ssh-deploy`

restart strider and check out the web ui -- you'll see a new plugin

configure the plugin with the deployment username, one or more hosts, and shell script to run on the hosts

### warning

it's pretty experimental at this time, be careful.

please provide feedback and let me know in the issues and/or in IRC if this package is hitting the spot for you or not, and if not, what you'd like to see done differently

thanks!
